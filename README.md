# one-pedal-acceleration-braking-system
This project deals with the design of a functionally safe controller for a one pedal acceleration/braking system according to ISO 26262 standard for automotive System to be implemented on a hybrid/electric vehicle.

The project is divided in 4 stages:
1. Lab 01: Item definition and Hazard Analysis and Risk Accessment
2. Lab 02: Simulink implementation of the controller as Finite State Machine
3. Lab 03: Functional safety implementation of Redundancy and Plausability, Unit and Integration testing
4. Lab 04: Full executable code generation for Arduino Uno, testing in SimulIDE environment and implementation on physical board (video).

## Tools
- MATLAB 2024b
- Simulink (StateFlow, Embedded Coder, Coverages, Arduino Support Package)
-Â SimulIDE
- Arduino Uno
